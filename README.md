# Xiegu-MiniMic
A Small Microphone for the Xiegu G90, X5105 and X6100 Radios. I have designed this to be assembled mostly by JLCPCB. 

After looking at the larger Microphone that comes with the radio, it appears to be a clone of the ICOM HM151 Hand Mic. Knowing this, I was able to use the service manual to create this PCB.

This is designed using KiCad Version 6.0.9

The Enclosure can be 3D Printed and requires 4 M2x20mm Socket Head Screws and 4 M2 Nuts. I used McMaster Carr Part numbers 91292A013 and 90591A111 for this project.

**Version History:**

Rev. A: Initial Design

Rev. B: Found that the EM6022P Microphone Element was wired backwards. Fixed it in this revision.
