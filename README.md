# Xiegu-MiniMic
A Small Microphone for the Xiegu G90, X5105 and X6100 Radios. I have designed this to be assembled mostly by JLCPCB. 

After looking at the larger Microphone that comes with the radio, it appears to be a clone of the ICOM HM151 Hand Mic. Knowing this, I was able to use the service manual to create this PCB.

This is designed using KiCad Version 6.0.9
